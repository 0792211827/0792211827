### 👋 Hi there, I'm WESLEY, a Data Scientist with a passion for unraveling insights from data.

🔍 I specialize in Data Science and Machine Learning, focusing on leveraging data to drive strategic decisions and unlock actionable insights.

🌱 My toolbox includes Python for advanced analytics, SQL for data manipulation, and proficiency in data visualization tools like PowerBI and Tableau.

📈 Whether it's building predictive models or diving deep into data analysis, I thrive on solving complex problems and turning raw data into meaningful solutions.

📚 When I'm not knee-deep in code, you can find me immersed in books, exploring new perspectives and expanding my knowledge horizon. I also enjoy unwinding with captivating YouTube channels.
